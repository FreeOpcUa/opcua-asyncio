"""Tests for certificate chain handling in the uacrypto module.

This module tests the enhanced x509_from_der function which now supports:
1. Loading single certificates (original functionality)
2. Loading the first certificate from a certificate chain
3. Proper error handling for invalid certificate data

These tests ensure that the function correctly handles certificate chains
that some OPC UA servers might provide, improving compatibility.
