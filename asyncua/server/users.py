A user needs:
-a "Role" e.g. Operator
-a list of "Permissions" e.g. [ua.PermissionType.Write]

Step1 would be to cleanup the UserRoles to the "Well-Known Roles" with the Spec. default PermissionType's
Step2(future development) could be to implementing
-the Evaluating (https://reference.opcfoundation.org/v104/Core/docs/Part3/4.8.3/) 
-RolePermissions (https://reference.opcfoundation.org/v104/Core/docs/Part3/5.2.9/)
